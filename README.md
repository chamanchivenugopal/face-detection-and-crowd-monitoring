# face-detection-and-crowd-monitoring
This project is a real-time Face Detection and Crowd Monitoring System developed to improve public safety by identifying faces and detecting violent or non-violent behaviors in crowded areas using deep learning techniques.

__Overview__

The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on datasets from Kaggle for crowd monitoring and behavior analysis in public spaces. Real-time video analysis is performed with OpenCV, enabling effective crowd surveillance and quick response to potential threats.

__Key Features__

Face Detection: Recognizes faces in live surveillance footage.<br>
Behavior Analysis: Differentiates between violent and non-violent actions in real-time.<br>
High Accuracy: Achieved 89% accuracy on testing data and 97.92% accuracy on training data.<br>
Real-time Processing: Detects incidents in live video feeds and notifies security personnel.<br>

__Results__

Testing Accuracy: 89%<br>
Training Accuracy: 97.92%<br>
Testing Loss: 0.2701<br>
Training Loss: 0.0647<br>

__Technology Stack__

Python<br>
OpenCV for video processing<br>
TensorFlow and Keras for model training<br>
NumPy for data handling<br>

__Installation__ <br>
1.Clone the repository<br>
2.Install the required dependencies<br>
3.Run the application<br>

__Usage__ <br>
Connect a video source (e.g., CCTV footage).<br>
Run the system to begin face detection and behavioral analysis.<br>
Real-time notifications will be generated for any detected violent behavior.<br>
__Future Enhancements__ <br>
Improved model performance in diverse lighting and crowd density conditions.<br>
Expansion to include object detection for broader safety monitoring.<br>
